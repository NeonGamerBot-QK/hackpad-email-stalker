## Hackpad tracker!

made in ruby and contains v\*be code

This was made because alex was like someone should make a hackpad tracker which uses airtable and nobody did it in time soooo i made it cuz i got bored.
at the time of writing this i still dont have prod creds so.

## How to run locally

I would recommend having ruby installed but pretty much:

1. populate .env (use the example env and add airtable creds and slack bot token)
2. run `bundle install` to install deps
3. run `ruby run src/main.rb` and check the app out!

uhh ruby is cool :3
